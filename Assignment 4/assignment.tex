\maketitle
You should implement your work in a Jupyter Notebook and it should contain proper documentation and be suitable to serve as a professional report (e.g., please be diligent in creating professional looking graphs including axis labels and units, as well as writing in a clear and technical language).

You will submit a {\texttt .ipynb} file, as well as a PDF version of the same file, through Canvas. Your notebook (and the PDF) should containing all of your solutions and comments to the tasks below.

\section{Hidden Markov Models}
During our review of Paper \#3 we learned about Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and their factorial variant, both in the context of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring. In this assignment we are going to use a simple toy example to implement some of the basic ideas of HMMs using baby steps.

To start, let's assume that you want to model the aggregate electricity consumption of a household that contains only 2 electrical appliances. Since we are only dealing with 2 appliances, we can collapse the Factorial HMM into an HMM that has one state for every combination of appliance states (i.e., we can have a single latent variable $Z$ that maintains the state of both appliances together). Thus, if we assume each of the individual appliances has two operating states, the resulting HMM will have a total of 4 hidden states, i.e. $Z \in \left\{(\text{off},\text{off}), (\text{on},\text{off}), (\text{off},\text{on}), (\text{on}, \text{on})\right\}$. For notational short-hand we will use: $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$ to refer to the states.

We will denote the latent variables by $Z$ and the observations by $X$, thus for the joint distribution of the HMMs the following holds: 

$p(x,z) = p(z_0) \prod_{t=1}^N p(x_t|z_t) p(z_t | z_{t-1})$

Let's further assume that the emission probabilities ($p(x_t|z|t)$) are Gaussian with a state-dependent mean and standard deviation, i.e.:

$p(x_t | z_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_t | \mu_{z_t}, \sigma^2_{z_t})$

\addtask{10}{If following this procedure you were to create an HMM for 22 two-state appliances, how much memory would your computer need if you wanted to fit the state-transition probability matrix into main memory with 4 byte precision (i.e., each value in the transition matrix would require 4 bytes of memory)?}

\subsection{Sampling from an HMM}
For the first portion of our implementation, we assume knowledge of the intial state, $\pi = p(z_0)$, state transition, $A = p(z_t|z_{t-1})$, and emission probabilities, $B = p(x_t | z_t)$ (i.e., we have all the parameters $\lambda = \left\{\pi, A, B\right\}$ for the HMM model already specified). Given these quantities, your task is to sample a time series of possible power values and hidden states, i.e. sample from $p(x,z)$. The easiest way to do this is to first sample a sequence of latent states $z$ by first sampling $z_0$ and then successively sample from $p(z_t|z_{t-1})$. Given the sequence of $z$, you can then sample an $x_t$ for every $z_t$.

\addtask{20}{Sample $(x_t,z_t) \sim p(x,z)$ with a length of 100, i.e., $t \in {1,2, \ldots, 100}$} 
\addtask{10}{Compute the likelihood of your sample under the specified model (i.e, under the given $\lambda$)}
\addtask{5}{Plot the sequence of observed power values $x$}

\subsection{Inference with an HMM}
For the next set of tasks, we are interested in inference. In other words, given a sequence of observations $x$, we want to tell something about the states of appliances.

First, we need to create a matrix $P1 \in (0,1)^{4 \times 100}$ where every entry contains the $p(z_t | x_t)$. You can compute this quantity from $p(x_t | z_t)$, i.e.: $p(z_t | x_t) = \frac{p(x_t | z_t) p(z_t)}{\sum_z p(x_t|z_t = z)p(z_t = z)}$

If we furthermore assume that $p(z_t)$ is uniform, then:

$p(z_t | x_t) = \frac{p(x_t | z_t)}{\sum_z p(x_t|z_t = z)}$

\addtask{10}{Generate matrix $P1$ as indicated above}

Now let's see if we can improve on our previous results by incorporating temporal dependencies between latent variables.

For this, we can estimate $p(z_t | x_{1:t})$, i.e. the probability of being in a latent state $z_t$ given all previous observations $x_{1:t} = x_1, ..., x_t$.

We can derive this as follows:

\begin{align}
	p(z_{t},x_{{1:t}})&=\sum _{{z_{{t-1}}}}p(z_{t},z_{{t-1}},x_{{1:t}})\\
	                  &=\sum _{{z_{{t-1}}}}p(x_{t}|z_{t},z_{{t-1}},x_{{1:t-1}})p(z_{t}|z_{{t-1}},x_{{1:t-1}})p(z_{{t-1}},x_{{1:t-1}})\\
	                  &=p(x_{t}|z_{t}) \sum _{{z_{{t-1}}}}p(z_{t}|z_{{t-1}})p(z_{{t-1}},x_{{1:t-1}})
\end{align}

Note that the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is the same as the last term of the right-hand side (RHS) when decrementing $t$ by $1$. Thus, we can compute $p(z_t, x_{1:t})$ recursively, i.e. first compute $p(z_1, x_1)$, followed by $p(z_2, x_{1:2})$, $\ldots$, until $p(z_t, x_{1:t})$ following the equation above.

\addtask{20}{Compute $p(z_t, x_{1:t})$ for all $t$ and store the values in a matrix P2}
\addtask{10}{Normalize the probabilities, i.e. compute $p(z_t|x_{1:t})$ and store the values in a matrix P3}
\addtask{10}{Plot P1 alongside P3 (use \texttt{plt.imshow(Px, aspect='auto', interpolation='nearest')} and compare to the ground truth.}
\addtask{5}{Did incorporating temporal dependencies help?}
